Paula Jones,lawsuit,Clinton,"The two men crossed paths when Kavanaugh was part of independent counsel Ken Starr's team that was investigating Clinton, and Bennett was Clinton's personal lawyer in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit in the mid-1990s, which ""hardly seems like the winning recipe for a close friendship,"" Bennett wrote.\nIn a 1997 ruling allowing Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton to go forward, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote: ""We have made clear that in a criminal case the powerful interest in the 'fair administration of criminal justice' requires that the evidence be given under appropriate circumstances lest the 'very integrity of the judicial system' be eroded.""\nThis was one of the arguments put forward in 1997 by then-president Bill Clinton in seeking the dismissal or postponement of the lawsuit brought by Paula Jones, in which she claimed he sexually harassed her when Clinton was governor of Arkansas.\nIn that dispute, the Supreme Court ruled Clinton could not invoke presidential immunity to postpone a civil lawsuit by Paula Jones, who said he had sexually harassed her when he was governor of Arkansas.\nIn that dispute, the Supreme Court ruled Clinton could not invoke presidential immunity to postpone a civil lawsuit by Paula Jones, who said he had sexually harassed her when he was governor of Arkansas.\nThe Starr investigation, for which Kavanaugh worked, was propelled forward partly by a 1997 Supreme Court decision, Clinton v.
