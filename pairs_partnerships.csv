Trans-Pacific Partnership,partnership,Trump,"It also bears mentioning that Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership gave away a large piece of economic leverage the US could have used against China.\nTrump said during a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that reentering the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a possibility if the US got a ""substantially better deal.""\nThe president criticized Japan both on Twitter and at a joint press briefing with Abe, who failed to win an exemption from U.S. tariffs on metals or convince Trump to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\nLast year, Trump yanked the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a huge free trade deal covering 12 nations on both sides of the ocean.\nIf Trump is concerned about treating American footwear companies and consumers fairly, then he should have signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership to lower footwear costs in the U.S., Priest said.\nHow It Happened NYT's Ana Swanson: ""The discussion on the trade deal began... when Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, questioned Mr. Trump about returning to the pact, arguing that the Trans-Pacific Partnership was the best way to put pressure on China."" ""\nAlso during his election campaign Mr Trump railed against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-nation trade deal that was a linchpin of former President Barack Obama's Asia policy.\nHe said the U.S. should revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Trump has rejected.\nTrump came to office on a promise to shield American workers from imports and his first action as president was to pull the United States out of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\nWithin days of taking office, Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive free trade deal involving a dozen countries that was negotiated under Obama.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/politics/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-negotiations/index.html\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/trump-nafta-tariffs-trade-war-2018-1\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-19/abe-gets-little-from-trump-to-douse-political-firestorm-in-japan\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2018/02/23/news/economy/asia-infrastructure-china-australia-us/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fmoney_latest+%28CNNMoney%3A+Latest+News%29\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-19/footwear-industry-slams-trump-s-claims-canadians-smuggle-shoes\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2018/04/13/technology/pacific-newsletter/index.html\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45364150\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/r-jpmorgans-dimon-praises-trumps-deregulatory-efforts-in-annual-letter-2018-4\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/trump-reportedly-looking-at-60-billion-tariffs-on-chinese-tech-imports-2018-3?utm_source=feedburner&amp%3Butm_medium=referral&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+businessinsider+%28Business+Insider%29\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2018/01/18/world/us-slips-behind-china-in-gallup-global-leadership-poll-intl/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fedition_world+%28RSS%3A+CNNi+-+World%29,1277.73010253906

Azure,partnership,Microsoft,"Announced on Wednesday, Microsoft will bring its Azure IoT Edge application to the table, VMware is being tapped for its Pulse IoT Centre to monitor and manage devices, and Dell is offering its dual-core Intel Atom Edge Gateways to the partnership.\nHere are summaries of a handful of the customer stories cited in the Microsoft blog: Saxo Bank, which offers banking as a service and access to 35,000 financial instruments in 170 countries is moving most of its technology stack to Azure to boost the power and scale of its services Eagle Investment Systems, which oversees $21 trillion in managed assets, is helping investment managers capture data and ensure its validity through a cloud-based data-management platform running on Azure that Eagle created in partnership with Microsoft.\nWhile Microsoft doesn't currently have a solution in Azure to directly output application code for iOS and Mac, this is not something that would be difficult for it to implement, especially if it did this in partnership with Apple.\nSome of the first announcements that caught my eye pertained to Microsoft s Azure IoT Edge technology, where, amongst other things, Microsoft announced a new partnership with DJI, developing drones, and Qualcomm, on a machine learning vision developer kit.\nOn the customer-as-partner angle, Schuster said she believes that while that dynamic is still in its very early stages, it could quickly evolve into a significant growth-driver for Microsoft because ""as we've started to talk with some customers about what they're building on and around Azure and other Microsoft technology, they're starting to express interest in becoming partners with Microsoft because that creates a whole different set of opportunities for them.""\nMicrosoft is offering startups co-selling resources to help get startups ready to sell to the enterprise in partnership with Microsoft; free cloud credits and technical support; development tools to help them build on Azure; and access to Microsoft Reactors, which are workspaces that Microsoft has in various cities.\nIn a move that could make life more difficult for Amazon's AWS unit, Walmart and Microsoft have signed a sweeping partnership to make Azure the centerpiece of Walmart's digital transformation, enabling the $500-billion commerce giant to analyze and act on sta…...\nA great example is our partnership with Deloitte, where we have jointly built a solution in the analytics space for them that they are bringing to market for their customers or through some of our channel partners that develop applications and work with customers themselves or by how we deliver the capability and our partnerships with places like Microsoft, Azure team or the Markley group where we are allowing customers to get access to Cray systems over the cloud.\nWhat made it more interesting is that Microsoft has invested an enormous amount of time, money, effort, and public relations into what is arguably their deepest partnership, certainly the most interlocked I have ever seen -- their relationship with Adobe and their positioning of the Adobe Digital Marketing Suite as the cloud (Azure of course) based enterprise especially B2C marketing automation offering.\nThis partnership is an extension as Microsoft and DJI were already DJI and Microsoft are already working together on precision farming where data is analyzed Azure IoT Edge with the FarmBeats solution.",https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-vmware-dell-team-up-on-iot-offering/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/04/27/microsoft-tops-amazon-in-q1-cloud-revenue-6-0-billion-to-5-44-billion-ibm-third-at-4-2-billion/\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wwdc-2018-served-as-macs-death-sentence/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2018/05/08/microsoft-build-2018-day-one-was-all-about-big-edge-iot-ai-and-mixed-reality-expansion/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/01/22/microsoft-unleashes-new-cloud-growth-via-go-to-market-program-including-customers-as-partners/\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-targets-startups-with-500-million-in-azure-related-resources/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2018/07/18/walmart-cio-we-picked-microsoft-for-huge-cloud-deal-to-accelerate-digital-transformation/\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4168311-crays-cray-ceo-peter-ungaro-q1-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-business-applications-speculation-over-microsoft-is-doubling-down/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2018/05/07/microsoft-shows-iot-momentum-with-new-support-from-qualcomm-nxp-and-dji/,71.6007690429688

North American Free Trade Agreement,partnership,NAFTA,"He tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) on his fourth day in office (not his first, as he had promised), reopened the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico last year, and recently started a virtual trade war (though mostly a war of words) with China.\nHowever, the inability of the WTO to address the issues related to data and e-commerce has been challenged for some time - this is especially relevant now with the rise of other smaller regional trade agreements such as Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which do cover digital trade rules.\nSince coming into office one year ago on a promise to put America first, Trump has pulled Washington out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), threatened to scrap the 90s-era North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to introduce steel tariffs that could hit European allies as well as China.\nIt s more interesting to note what was not mentioned in the speech: the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); the trade deal with South Korea (KORUS); the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP); the trade deficit; the global economy (Europe, Japan, Latin America); sectoral targets of Trump administration protection steel, aluminum, solar panels, washing machines.\nIt comes as its main trading relationship with the United States -- the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- falters, and after Ottawa announced it would sign onto the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).\nMany economists had expected prices to start creeping up last year in response to President Trump s nationalist America first agenda, complete with new tariffs, strong crackdown on illegal immigration, cancellation of U.S. participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nNot only has the president rolled new tariffs on allies including Canada, Mexico, and the EU, but he has also turned away from major free-trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and floated the idea of pulling the US out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.\nThis year promises to be a decisive one for trade, with results likely for renegotiations on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS), and the now Japan-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\nThe groups said they would advocate that Trump reduce or eliminate trade barriers by modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and returning to the negotiating table on the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).\nSince his campaign, Trump has questioned U.S. trade deals, threatening to restructure the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/salvatorebabones/2018/04/13/trump-may-join-the-new-tpp-but-only-because-the-old-one-was-gutted/\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/brazil-demands-rules-on-data-flows-from-wto/\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/r-america-last-eu-says-trump-is-losing-on-trade-2018-1\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/phillevy/2018/01/31/president-trumps-remarkably-tame-take-on-trade/\nhttp://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/canada-to-seek-to-join-south-america-trade-pact/article/515122\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/01/08/its-time-for-the-fear-trade-to-move-gold-prices/\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/eu-japan-free-trade-deal-trump-tariffs-2018-7\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/global-trade-might-not-survive-2018-2018-1\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/r-free-trade-puts-republican-megadonors-on-collision-course-with-trump-2018-6\nhttp://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2018/01/24/america-first-does-not-mean-america-alone-kellyanne-conway.html,43.157054901123
