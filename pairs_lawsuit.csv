DACA,lawsuit,Trump,"The Trump administration had used the possibility of a court immediately terminating DACA in response to such a lawsuit from Paxton as the justification for ending the program altogether -- a justification the federal judge in DC found flimsy.\nPaxton then once again set in motion a series of events -- issuing Trump an ultimatum to either rescind DACA and wind it down, or he would file to add the program to the litigation before Hanen, who was widely expected to reject the program on the same reasoning he rejected DAPA.\nThe program's protections are due to start expiring on March 5, but federal judges have blocked Trump's bid to end DACA while litigation over the matter continues.\nThe program's protections are due to start expiring on March 5, but federal judges have blocked Trump's bid to end DACA while litigation over the matter continues.\nThe decision is similar to an earlier ruling by a federal judge in San Francisco that DACA must remain in place while litigation over Trump's decision unfolds.\nA US judge blocked Trump's moves to end DACA while litigation unfolds.\nWhile court rulings have blocked the Trump administration from ending the program for now, and have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to resume renewing DACA permits, those actions can always be overturned by a higher court as litigation works its way through the system.\n"" Using DACA as a 'bargaining chip' Alsup also noted the possibility that Trump's termination of the program was ""contrived to give the administration a bargaining chip to demand funding for a border wall,"" as the plaintiffs had argued in their lawsuit.\nU.S. District Court Judge William Alsup, a Clinton appointee, has acted to temporarily block the Trump administration from phasing out DACA until litigation plays out or congress comes up with a legislative solution.\nIn political news, Texas and six other states have filed suit against the federal government to try to put an end to DACA, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly has considered a subpoena to force President Trump to answer questions.",https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/politics/daca-lawsuit-challenge-texas/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_allpolitics+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Politics%29\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2018/05/02/politics/daca-lawsuit-judge-hanen-ken-paxton-deja-vu/index.html\nhttp://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2018/02/14/u-s-senate-showdown-over-dreamer-immigrants-seen-thursday.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxbusiness%2Flatest+%28Internal+-+Latest+News+-+Text%29\nhttp://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2018/02/14/u-s-senate-showdown-over-dreamer-immigrants-seen-thursday.html\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/r-second-us-judge-blocks-trump-administration-from-ending-daca-program-2018-2\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/the-10-most-important-things-in-the-world-right-now-january-10-2018-1\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2018/03/22/politics/daca-left-out-omnibus-whats-next/index.html\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/a-judge-has-once-again-used-trumps-own-tweets-against-him-in-court-2018-1\nhttp://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2018/01/10/federal-courts-are-filled-with-democrats-trying-to-subvert-trump-dobbs.html\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/once-hated-energy-stocks-are-now-too-popular-heres-when-to-plunge-in-2018-05-02?siteid=rss&rss=1,74.5556945800781
